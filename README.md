# paediatric-pneumonia

Pediatric pneumonia is a major infectious disease which causes more than 5,00,000 deaths of infants and children below 5 years of age. This number is equivalent to death of one child per minute. These statistics are daunting and more focused studies and development of tools are required to tackle this challenge. MobileNeT-V3 architecture is implemented over two different datasets. The model has shown a classification accuracy of 95.8% over dataset 1 and 97.8% over dataset 2.
